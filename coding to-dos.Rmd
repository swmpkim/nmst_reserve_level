To-dos  

+  Decisions:  
    +  do we want to keep "top 3" plots 
    +  find out exactly what the data frame should look like going into the multivariate analyses  
    +  which nesting structure to use  
    +  do we want richness and diversity for each plot on each date? can use in univariate analyses  
    
+  Documentation:  
    +  will remove quilt plot  
    +  combine namaste groups etc.  
    +  more descriptive model names and information  
    +  show which species are within each category used in the anaSpec_df data frames - for each application (spatial plots, univariate responses, multivariate responses)  
+  Other:  
    +  after exploration but before statistical analyses, remove any plots without at least [X] readings.  
    +  univariate analyses might barf if a reserve doesn't specify at least 3 species or groups  
    +  figure out how to look at the provided Plant_Categories and see if any species were removed because they were named separately - and if so, rename it to "Other [category]" in all anaSpec_df data frames  
    +  incorporate CIs into model fit plots?
