## About  

These tabs are the multivariate analyses.  

```{r mod-multivar-df}
# widen out the univar data frame
# it's grouped appropriately for these analyses 

# trying to use more realistic df: grouped by nmst categories
dat_multivar <- dat_nmst_cats
```

```{r}
# remove any plots without at least 3 distinct years of data
dat_multivar <- filter(dat_multivar, !(StTrnsPlt %in% not_enough$StTrnsPlt))
```

```{r, results = "asis"}
# if there weren't enough years of data, can't do the rest.
# set up to NOT evaluate code chunks, and spit out a message.
datEnough <- nrow(dat_multivar) > 0

if(!datEnough){
    cat("### **Multivariate analyses were not run.**")
    cat("\n \nThere were not enough rows of data.")
}
```


In this section, we use ordination to visualize and analyze plant communities through plot-level cover data and explanatory variables (e.g., distance to water, elevation, salinity) across sites and marsh zones, when appropriate. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) with loading factors (when appropriate) will be used to visualize the data. Loading factors can be key species or groupings (e.g., dominant species, bare, halophytes) or explanatory variables. We also plan to use  similarity analysis (SIMPER) to identify which cover categories are contributing to dissimilarity. A PERMANOVA incorporating appropriate explanatory variables (e.g., site, zone) will also be used to test for differences between years (test comparing first and last years may have the greatest power).
  


### Questions addressed  

-  Are there shifts in the vegetation community (as defined by the entire percent-cover matrix) over time? Do these shifts vary by vegetation zone?  
    -  addressed with PERMANOVA, comparing first two and most recent two years of monitoring. (If there are <4 years of data, only the first and last year are compared)  
    -  if overall PERMANOVA indicated significant change (p < 0.05), follow-up pairwise PERMANOVAs were run comparing first vs. last years for each zone.  
-  Which species/groups contribute most to these shifts?  
    -  addressed using SIMPER, comparing first and last year(s) of monitoring data within each zone. SIMPER is only used to follow up on vegetation zones that indicated a significant community difference in the PERMANOVA.  
-  Where is the plant community changing, and what characteristics do those areas have in common (e.g. site, zone, distance from water, elevation)?  
    -  visualized via NMDS.  

### Reserve output choices  

The following species/groups were identified by the reserve as important loading factors to display on NMDS outputs.  

```{r show-userChoice-multivar, results = 'asis'}
choices <- anaSpec_list$multivar$Choice
choices <- choices[!is.na(choices)]
cat("Up to 8 species/groups could be identified specifically in outputs of these multivariate analyses. Reserve choices are: \n")
```

```{r userChoice-2, results = 'asis'}
cat(paste("*", choices), sep="\n")
```

## PERMANOVA  

```{r, results = "asis"}
# if there weren't enough years of data, can't do the rest.
# set up to NOT evaluate code chunks, and spit out a message.
datEnough <- nrow(dat_multivar) > 0

### Post-hoc output  

Was there a community difference between "Start" (first 2 years) and "End" (last 2 years) for each zone?  

```{r show-perm-posthoc, eval = datEnough}
pmvs_summ <- bind_rows(pmvs, .id = "Vegetation Zone") %>% 
    filter(term == "Time_group") %>% 
    select('Vegetation Zone', R2, p.value) %>% 
    mutate(Bonferroni_p.value = p.adjust(p.value, method = "bonferroni"))

kbl_nmst(pmvs_summ,
      digits = 4,
      caption = "Summary of pairwise PERMANOVAs testing community difference between first and most recent years of monitoring")
```



<details><summary>Click to see complete anova tables for each pairwise comparison</summary>  

Note - these individual tables do not contain Bonferroni-adjusted p-values; only the raw values.  

```{r show-pairwise-perm, results = 'asis', eval = datEnough}
for(i in seq_along(pmvs)){
    print(kbl_nmst(x = pmvs[[i]], 
                caption = paste0("Pairwise results for Vegetation Zone ", names(pmvs)[i]),
                digits = c(0, 0, 2, 4, 2, 4))
          )
}
```

</details>

## SIMPER  

```{r, results = "asis"}
# if there weren't enough years of data, can't do the rest.
# set up to NOT evaluate code chunks, and spit out a message.
datEnough <- nrow(dat_multivar) > 0

if(!datEnough){
    cat("### **Multivariate analyses were not run.**")
    cat("\n \nThere were not enough rows of data.")
}
```

If the PERMANOVA for a single zone had a significant p-value (p < 0.05; *not* adjusted for multiple comparisons due to exploratory nature of these analyses), indicating a significant community change between the first and last years of monitoring, a SIMPER was performed. The top 6 species in output are below.  

"average" is the average contribution of that species to community differences (think of 0.10 as a 10% contribution); "sd" is the standard deviation. "cumulative" is the [scaled, as the averages may not add up to 1] cumulative contribution for this species and all those above it in the table. Typically people only report species up to the one that brings "cumulative" over 0.7. "p" is a p-value for that species based on permutation tests.  


```{r show-simper, results = 'asis', eval = datEnough}
for(i in seq_along(simps)){
    print(kbl_nmst(x = simps[[i]], 
                   caption = paste0("Vegetation Zone: ", names(simps)[i], " - SIMPER results"),
                   digits = 4)
    )
}
```

## NMDS  

```{r, results = "asis"}
# if there weren't enough years of data, can't do the rest.
# set up to NOT evaluate code chunks, and spit out a message.
datEnough <- nrow(dat_multivar) > 0

if(!datEnough){
    cat("### **Multivariate analyses were not run.**")
    cat("\n \nThere were not enough rows of data.")
}
```


```{r stats-run-nmds, eval = datEnough}
    mds_resp <- metaMDS(resp_pm, distance = "bray", k = 3,
                        autotransform = FALSE, trace = 0)
    # plot(mds_resp, type = "t")
    
    data.scores <- as.data.frame(scores(mds_resp)$sites)
    species.scores <- as.data.frame(scores(mds_resp)$species)
    species.scores$species <- rownames(species.scores) 
    
    # only keep the species listed as reserve choices, to reduce clutter on graphic
    species.scores <- species.scores %>% 
        filter(species %in% unique(anaSpec_list$multivar$Choice))
    
    # data.scores$Vegetation_Zone <- expl$Vegetation_Zone
    # data.scores$Year <- expl$Year
    data.scores <- data.scores %>%
        mutate(Zone = expl_pm$Vegetation_Zone,
               Year = as.factor(expl_pm$Year),
               Time_group = as.factor(expl_pm$Time_group),
               Zone_Timegroup = as.factor(expl_pm$Zone_Timegroup)) %>% 
        separate(Zone, into = c("Zone_abbrev", "Zone_full"),
                 sep = "-")  
```

Final 3-dimensional NMDS stress was `r ifelse(datEnough, round(mds_resp$stress, 4), "NMDS not run")`.  

#### How to read these NMDS plots  

-  Navy diamonds represent the centroid for each Vegetation Zone/Time period combination. They are labelled with the Vegetation Zone abbreviation and 'Start' or 'End'. Upon hover, the full Vegetation Zone name and year(s) represented will be provided.  
-  Black arrows and text represent Species or Categories of vegetation (e.g. H-Halophyte). Hovering over the arrow will provide the Species or Category name.  
-  Points represent individual plots and are colored by Vegetation Zone; hovering does not yield output for points.


```{r stats-prep-nmds-groups, eval = datEnough}
# get centroids for each time/zone group
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/47523181
cent <- aggregate(cbind(NMDS1, NMDS2, NMDS3) ~ Zone_Timegroup, data = data.scores, FUN = mean)

en_coord_cat <- cent %>%

             sep = "; ") %>%
    left_join(keeps2,
              by = c("Zone" = "Vegetation_Zone",
                     "Time_group")) %>% 
    separate(Zone, into = c("Zone_abbrev", "Zone_full"),
             sep = "-") %>%
    mutate(Zone_Timegroup = paste(Zone_abbrev, Time_group),
           Zone_Years = paste(Zone_full, Years, sep = ": "))
