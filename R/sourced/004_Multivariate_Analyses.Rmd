## About  

These tabs are the multivariate analyses.  

```{r mod-multivar-df}
# use data frame where unvegetated 'species' are grouped by nmst categories
dat_multivar <- dat_nmst_cats
```

```{r}
# remove any plots without at least 3 distinct years of data
dat_multivar <- filter(dat_multivar, !(StTrnsPlt %in% not_enough$StTrnsPlt))
```

```{r, results = "asis"}
# if there weren't enough years of data, can't do the rest.
# set up to NOT evaluate code chunks, and spit out a message.
datEnough <- nrow(dat_multivar) > 0

if(!datEnough){
    cat("### **Multivariate analyses were not run.**")
    cat("\n \nThere were not enough rows of data.")
}
```


In this section, we use ordination to visualize and analyze plant communities through plot-level cover data and explanatory variables (e.g., distance to water, elevation, salinity) across sites and marsh zones, when appropriate. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) with loading factors (when appropriate) will be used to visualize the data. Loading factors can be key species or groupings (e.g., dominant species, bare, halophytes) or explanatory variables. We also plan to use  similarity analysis (SIMPER) to identify which cover categories are contributing to dissimilarity. A PERMANOVA incorporating appropriate explanatory variables (e.g., site, zone) will also be used to test for differences between years (test comparing first and last years may have the greatest power).
  


### Questions addressed  

-  Are there shifts in the vegetation community (as defined by the entire percent-cover matrix) over time? Do these shifts vary by vegetation zone?  
    -  addressed with PERMANOVA, comparing first two and most recent two years of monitoring. (If there are <4 years of data, only the first and last year are compared)  
    -  if overall PERMANOVA indicated significant change (p < 0.05), follow-up pairwise PERMANOVAs were run comparing first vs. last years for each zone.  
-  Which species/groups contribute most to these shifts?  
    -  addressed using SIMPER, comparing first and last year(s) of monitoring data within each zone. SIMPER is only used to follow up on vegetation zones that indicated a significant community difference in the PERMANOVA.  
-  Where is the plant community changing, and what characteristics do those areas have in common (e.g. site, zone, distance from water, elevation)?  
    -  visualized via NMDS.  

### Reserve output choices  

The following species/groups were identified by the reserve as important loading factors to display on NMDS outputs.  

```{r show-userChoice-multivar, results = 'asis'}
choices <- anaSpec_list$multivar$Choice
choices <- choices[!is.na(choices)]
cat("Up to 8 species/groups could be identified specifically in outputs of these multivariate analyses. Reserve choices are: \n")
```

```{r userChoice-2, results = 'asis'}
cat(paste("*", choices), sep="\n")
```

## PERMANOVA  

```{r, results = "asis"}
# if there weren't enough years of data, can't do the rest.
# set up to NOT evaluate code chunks, and spit out a message.
datEnough <- nrow(dat_multivar) > 0

for(i in seq_along(zones)){
    # subset data to this zone
    zn = zones[i]
    tmp_index <- which(expl_pm$Vegetation_Zone == zn)

    # if permanova was significant, run SIMPER

}

### Post-hoc output  

Was there a community difference between "Start" (first 2 years) and "End" (last 2 years) for each zone?  

```{r show-perm-posthoc, eval = datEnough}
pmvs_summ <- bind_rows(pmvs, .id = "Vegetation Zone") %>% 
    filter(term == "Time_group") %>% 
    select('Vegetation Zone', R2, p.value) %>% 
    mutate(Bonferroni_p.value = p.adjust(p.value, method = "bonferroni"))

kbl_nmst(pmvs_summ,
      digits = 4,
      caption = "Summary of pairwise PERMANOVAs testing community difference between first and most recent years of monitoring")
```



<details><summary>Click to see complete anova tables for each pairwise comparison</summary>  

Note - these individual tables do not contain Bonferroni-adjusted p-values; only the raw values.  

```{r show-pairwise-perm, results = 'asis', eval = datEnough}
for(i in seq_along(pmvs)){
    print(kbl_nmst(x = pmvs[[i]], 
                caption = paste0("Pairwise results for Vegetation Zone ", names(pmvs)[i]),
                digits = c(0, 0, 2, 4, 2, 4))
          )
}
```

</details>

## SIMPER  

```{r, results = "asis"}
# if there weren't enough years of data, can't do the rest.
# set up to NOT evaluate code chunks, and spit out a message.
datEnough <- nrow(dat_multivar) > 0

if(!datEnough){
    cat("### **Multivariate analyses were not run.**")
    cat("\n \nThere were not enough rows of data.")
}
```

If the PERMANOVA for a single zone had a significant p-value (p < 0.05; *not* adjusted for multiple comparisons due to exploratory nature of these analyses), indicating a significant community change between the first and last years of monitoring, a SIMPER was performed. The top 6 species in output are below.  

"average" is the average contribution of that species to community differences; "sd" is the standard deviation of the species' contribution. "cumulative" is the cumulative % contribution [averages are not %s but cumulative is scaled] for this species and all those above it in the table. Typically people only report species up to the one that brings "cumulative" over 0.7. "p" is a p-value for that species based on permutation tests. "mean_start" is the mean cover of that species in the starting year(s), and "mean_end" is the mean cover of the species in the last year(s) of monitoring.  


```{r show-simper, results = 'asis', eval = datEnough}
for(i in seq_along(simps)){
    print(kbl_nmst(x = simps[[i]], 
                   caption = paste0("Vegetation Zone: ", names(simps)[i], " - SIMPER results"),
                   digits = 4)
    )
}
```

## NMDS  

```{r, results = "asis"}
# if there weren't enough years of data, can't do the rest.
# set up to NOT evaluate code chunks, and spit out a message.
datEnough <- nrow(dat_multivar) > 0

if(!datEnough){
    cat("### **Multivariate analyses were not run.**")
    cat("\n \nThere were not enough rows of data.")
}
```


```{r stats-run-nmds, eval = datEnough}

    # first get everything to group
    species.scores <- species.scores %>% 
        left_join(species_info, by = c("species" = "Species")) %>%

        mutate(Zone = expl_pm$Vegetation_Zone,
               Year = as.factor(expl_pm$Year),
               Time_group = as.factor(expl_pm$Time_group),
               Zone_Timegroup = as.factor(expl_pm$Zone_Timegroup)) %>% 
        separate(Zone, into = c("Zone_abbrev", "Zone_full"),

Final 3-dimensional NMDS stress was `r ifelse(datEnough, round(mds_resp$stress, 4), "NMDS not run")`.  

#### How to read these NMDS plots  

-  Large points represent the centroid for each Vegetation Zone/Time period combination. They are labelled with the Vegetation Zone abbreviation and 'Start' or 'End'. Additionally, they are colored by Vegetation Zone and shaped by 'Start' vs. 'End' time periods. Upon hover, the full Vegetation Zone name and year(s) represented will be provided.  
-  Black arrows and text represent Species or Categories of vegetation (e.g. H-Halophyte) identified by the reserve. Hovering over the arrow will provide the Species or Category name.  
-  Small points represent individual plots and are colored by Vegetation Zone and shaped by 'Start' vs. 'End' time periods (shapes and colors match the large points above); hovering does not yield output for points.
