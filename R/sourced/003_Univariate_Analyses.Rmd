## About the Univariate Analyses  

Each of the (up to) 4 response variables identified in the Analysis Specs spreadsheet, and EIR, will have its results appear in its own tab. You will see the same tables and graphics for each.

List parameters of interest, identified in spreadsheet input.  


For each parameter of interest, run the model, then display tables and figures of model output (including estimated marginal slopes).  


My original version of this used the wide data file, but I think I'm going to be preferring the long one, and filtering based on the selected response parameter.

## EIR   

```{r}
resp <- "EIR"
```


```{r, child = "003a_model_run.Rmd"}

```


## Response 1  

```{r}
resp <- "Spartina alterniflora"
# but really want to make that adapt to user input
```

```{r, child = "003a_model_run.Rmd"}

```
