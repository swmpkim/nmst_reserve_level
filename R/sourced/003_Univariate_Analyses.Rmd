## About  

Each of the (up to) 4 response variables identified in the Analysis Specs spreadsheet, plus EMI (Ecotone Migration Index), species richness, and Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index, will have results appear in its own tab. You will see the same tables and graphics for each.  

### Questions addressed  

-  Are there shifts in key vegetation species/groups over time?  
-  Do these shifts vary by vegetation zone?  
-  Follow-up: Where is the plant community changing (which plots) and what characteristics do those areas have in common (e.g. site, zone, distance from water, elevation)?  


### Statistical Model  

The main statistical model used is a linear mixed model, via `lme4::lmer()`, with the form `y ~ Vegetation Zone + Time + Zone*Time + 1|Plot`, where `y` is the response variable given in the tab, and each individual plot has a random intercept.  


### Reserve-identified response variables:  

The reserve-identified univariate response variables are:  

```{r show-userChoice-univar, results = 'asis'}
cat(paste("*", anaSpec_list$univar$Choice), sep="\n")
```

```{r mod-univar-df}
# widen out the univar data frame
# it's grouped appropriately for these analyses  
dat_univar <- anaSpec_dfs$univar %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = Species_or_Group,
                values_from = Cover)

# join EMI - use a join because rows might not be in same order
EMI_df <- dat %>% 
    select(StTrnsPlt, Year, Month, Day, EMI)

dat_univar <- left_join(dat_univar, EMI_df) %>% 
    left_join(dat_div)
```

```{r}
# remove plots that don't have at readings in at least 3 separate years
dat_univar <- filter(dat_univar, !(StTrnsPlt %in% not_enough$StTrnsPlt))
```


### Custom Metrics  

Any custom metrics specified in the 'Analysis_Specs' sheet of the 'veg-specs.xlsx' file are calculated here, for inclusion in univariate analyses.  

If you do not see a tab for a metric you believe you defined, look just below these bullet points to see if there are error messages showing up in little boxes that are different from other text - these may be helpful in troubleshooting. There are a few likely reasons for problems:  

-  Make sure the species or groupings you want to use are in the 'Species_Names' sheet of your data file.  
-  Make sure any species or groupings are enclosed in backticks. **Backticks are not the same as single quotes or apostrophes.** To make a backtick, use the key to the left of the number 1 on your keyboard.  
-  Make sure species and groups are spelled correctly.  
-  Make sure species and groups are capitalized correctly ("correctly" = however it is capitalized in the 'Species_Names' sheet of the data file). e.g., if you want to include 'live vegetation' in your metric, check the Species_Names sheet of the data file and you will see it is 'Live vegetation'. If you capitalize it any other way, R will not recognize it and thus will not calculate the metric.  
-  Check your math - if you are using division, try adding 1 to the denominator to avoid the possibility of dividing by 0. Make sure you have parentheses around terms that should be evaluated together.  

```{r custom-calcs}
# allow for custom names for the custom metrics
custom_name1 <- addlOptions$Choice[addlOptions$R_param == "Custom_metric1_name"]
custom_name1 <- ifelse(is.na(custom_name1) | custom_name1 == "", "Custom_metric1", custom_name1)

custom_name2 <- addlOptions$Choice[addlOptions$R_param == "Custom_metric2_name"]
custom_name2 <- ifelse(is.na(custom_name2) | custom_name2 == "", "Custom_metric2", custom_name2)

# process custom metrics 

# first custom metric
if("custom1" %in% anaSpecs$R_varName){
    user_formula1 <- anaSpecs$Choice[anaSpecs$R_varName == "custom1"]
    user_formula1_parsed <- rlang::parse_expr(user_formula1)
    terms1 <- extract_terms(user_formula1)
    dat_custom <- process_custom_metric_terms(terms = terms1,
                                              dat = dat)
    
    # make formulas vector for printing
    formulas <- user_formula1

}

# second custom metric - dat_custom should already exist from custom 1
if("custom2" %in% anaSpecs$R_varName){
    user_formula2 <- anaSpecs$Choice[anaSpecs$R_varName == "custom2"]
    user_formula2_parsed <- rlang::parse_expr(user_formula2)
    
    terms2 <- extract_terms(user_formula2)
    dat_custom <- process_custom_metric_terms(terms = terms2,
                                              dat = dat_custom)
    
    formulas <- c(formulas, user_formula2)
}

# if at least one custom metric exists,
# calculate it/them and run the analyses
if(exists("dat_custom")){
    # now that all the proper columns exist, do the math
    # custom metric 1 must exist for dat_custom to exist
    try(
        dat_custom <- dat_custom %>% 
            mutate(!!custom_name1 := !!user_formula1_parsed)
    )
    
    # custom metric 2 may or may not exist, so make it an if statement
    if("custom2" %in% anaSpecs$R_varName){
        try(
            dat_custom <- dat_custom %>% 
                mutate(!!custom_name2 := !!user_formula2_parsed)
        )
    }
    
    # select proper columns
    dat_custom <- dat_custom %>% 
        select(Reserve:Total,
               starts_with(custom_name1),
               starts_with(custom_name2))
}
```




```{r}
# set up a list of univariate output info
# estimates, CIs, etc.
# in case we ever want to generate a summary spreadsheet
univar_outputs <- list()
```



## EMI   

EMI, Ecotone Migration Index, is the proportional cover of species/covers or species/cover groupings that are expected to increase within a vegetation zone as sea level rises. These species were identified by reserve staff, for each zone, in the 'veg-specs.xlsx' file. 

Species considered to be 'migrators' within each zone are denoted by 'x' in the following table:  

```{r show-eir-spps}
kableExtra::kable(emi_spps, align = "c") %>% 
    kable_styling("striped") %>%
    scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "200px") 
```


```{r define-univar-EMI}
respn <- "EMI"
dat_univar$resp <- unlist(dat_univar[which(names(dat_univar) == respn)])
```


```{r source-003-EMI, child = "003a_model_run.Rmd"}

```



## Richness  

Species Richness, calculated on all non-abiotic, non-dead, and non-overstory columns; using the `vegan` package.

```{r define-univar-richness}
respn <- "Richness"
dat_univar$resp <- unlist(dat_univar[which(names(dat_univar) == respn)])
```

```{r source-003a-userChosen1b, child = "003a_model_run.Rmd"}

```



## Diversity  

Shannon-Weiner Diversity index, calculated on all non-abiotic, non-dead, and non-overstory columns; using the `vegan` package.  

```{r define-univar-diversity}
respn <- "SWdiv"
dat_univar$resp <- unlist(dat_univar[which(names(dat_univar) == respn)])
```

```{r source-003a-userChosen1c, child = "003a_model_run.Rmd"}

```




```{r, results = "asis"}
# user-identified univariate responses  
respns <- anaSpec_list$univar$Choice
for(i in seq_along(respns)){
    respn <- respns[i]
    cat("\n")
    cat("##", respn, "\n")
    dat_univar$resp <- unlist(dat_univar[which(names(dat_univar) == respn)])
    chld <- knitr::knit_child("003a_model_run.Rmd", quiet = TRUE)
    cat(chld, sep = "\n")
}
```


```{r, results = "asis"}
# custom metrics

if(exists("dat_custom")){    
    # custom metric columns:
    respns <- names(dat_custom)[which(names(dat_custom) %in% c(custom_name1, custom_name2))]
    
    # join with the univariate data frame
    # left join in case the number of rows differs; let dat_univar decide
    dat_univar <- left_join(dat_univar, dat_custom)
    
    for(i in seq_along(respns)){
        respn <- respns[i]
        cat("\n")
        cat("##", respn, "\n")
        cat("\n", "This custom metric was calculated using the following formula: \n\n", formulas[i], "\n\n")
 
        dat_univar$resp <- unlist(dat_univar[which(names(dat_univar) == respn)])
        chld <- knitr::knit_child("003a_model_run.Rmd", quiet = TRUE)
        cat(chld, sep = "\n")
    }
    
}
```
